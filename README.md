# oh-my-zsh-themes
oh-my-zsh themes for better prompt visibility with dark themed macOS Sonoma+

# Usage
Source `theme/sorin-extended.zsh-theme` into terminal

# What changed
- Prompt indicates if git state is dirty. Was not supported in original theme
- Prompt fonts are bold now for better visibility
- Prompt git section is now `magenta` instead of `dark blue` for visibility on dark themed terminals like "iTerm" and "Visual Studio terminal"

## Inspiration
The official `sorin.zsh-theme`
